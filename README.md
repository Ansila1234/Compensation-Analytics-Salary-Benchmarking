# Compensation-Analytics-Salary-Benchmarking
This project focuses on analyzing employee compensation, benchmarking salaries against market data, and optimizing bonuses. Using advanced Excel techniques, an interactive Compensation Dashboard was developed to help HR teams identify salary discrepancies, optimize pay structures, and ensure fair compensation. 
 # 1. Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing employee compensation, benchmarking salaries against market data, and optimizing bonuses. Using advanced Excel techniques, an interactive Compensation Dashboard was developed to help HR teams identify salary discrepancies, optimize pay structures, and ensure fair compensation.

# 2. Data Collection & Preparation
To ensure accurate analysis, two datasets were used:

### Employee Compensation Data (10,000+ records)
+ Contains fields such as Base Salary, Bonus %, Overtime Hours, Total Compensation, and Experience.
+ **Goal**: Identify salary trends and compare pay structures across departments.
### Market Benchmark Data
+ Lists average industry salaries per job title for comparison.
+ **Goal**: Help HR teams spot underpaid and overpaid employees.
### Data Processing in Excel
✅ Power Query automated data cleaning, ensuring there were no duplicates, missing values, or inconsistencies.
✅ Formula-Based Salary Calculation was implemented:

Total Compensation = Base Salary + (Base Salary * Bonus %) + (Overtime Hours * Overtime Rate)
✅ Market salaries were dynamically fetched using VLOOKUP and INDEX/MATCH for flexibility.

# 3. Advanced Excel Techniques Used
This project extensively used advanced Excel functions to transform raw data into a fully interactive dashboard.

✅ Salary Benchmarking with VLOOKUP & INDEX/MATCH
Compared employee salaries against market data.
Used INDEX/MATCH instead of VLOOKUP to handle non-sequential job titles efficiently.
✅ Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts for Insights
Created department-wise compensation summaries.
Used Pivot Tables to analyze salary trends based on experience.
Developed Pivot Charts (Bar, Scatter, and Pie) to make insights visually compelling.
✅ Conditional Formatting for Salary Insights
Highlighted underpaid employees in RED (earning below 90% of the market benchmark).
Marked highly paid employees in GREEN (earning 110%+ of the benchmark).
Bonus discrepancies were flagged, helping HR restructure incentives.
✅ Data Validation & Dropdowns for Filtering
Created drop-down menus to dynamically filter compensation data by:
Department
Job Title
Experience Level
Allowed instant insights without manually changing the dataset.

# 4. Key Insights & Recommendations
The Compensation Dashboard provided clear, data-driven insights for HR teams:

+ 30% of employees were underpaid compared to industry benchmarks.
+ IT & Finance departments had the highest total compensation.
+ Marketing had the most uneven bonus distribution.
+ Adjusting base salaries by 5% would align 80% of employees with market rates.
+ Implementing an optimized bonus structure would improve retention & motivation.

# 5. Final Deliverables
+ Interactive Compensation Dashboard with real-time salary insights.
+ Pivot Table Summary Reports for data-driven HR decisions.
+ Automated salary benchmarking using Power Query & Solver.

# 6. Conclusion
This project highlights advanced Excel skills including Power Query, Pivot Tables, Solver, and Scenario Planning to analyze, optimize, and automate salary benchmarking. The final dashboard provides actionable insights for HR teams to make informed compensation decisions, reduce pay gaps, and enhance workforce satisfaction.
